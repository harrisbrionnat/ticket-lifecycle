  1. Login as an admin/analyst with the appropriate credentials to work this specific ticket.
  2. Once he is logged in, he will be able to immediately see his open tickets, including the one from Bill Harris in the Dashboard. 
  3. You, the analyst, will be able to do things like, modify the priority level, transfer to a different department, change to SLA Plan or Due Date, etc. You can post notes regarding the ticket that you don't want the end user to see, by posting it under  'Internal Notes'. You can also provide additional notes to the end user (Bill) under the tab 'Post Reply'.
